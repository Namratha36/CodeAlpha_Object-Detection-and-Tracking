##  Features
- **Real-time object detection** using YOLOv8 model
- **Multi-object tracking** with DeepSORT algorithm  
- **Live webcam processing** with OpenCV
- **Visual feedback** with bounding boxes and tracking IDs
- **Performance metrics** displayed in real-time

##  Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV - Computer vision
- Ultralytics YOLOv8 - Object detection
- DeepSORT - Multi-object tracking
- NumPy & PyTorch

## Installation

pip install opencv-python ultralytics deep-sort-realtime numpy torch torchvision
##  Usage

python object_detection_tracking.py


**Controls:**
- Press 'q' or ESC to quit
- Move around to test tracking

##  Results
- **Green boxes:** Object detections with confidence scores
- **Blue boxes:** Object tracking with unique IDs  
- **Real-time stats:** Frame count and detection metrics
